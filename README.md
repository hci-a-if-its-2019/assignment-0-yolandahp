## Snapchat
Snapchat is a mobile application used to share photos, videos, text, and drawings. It has become popular in a very short space of time, especially with young people. Snapchat was developed by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, two Stanford University students.

In my opinion, here is one of reasons why Snapchat has bad UI:

### Disappearing Messages
When you're trying to have conversations, the messages will disappear from the recipientâ€™s phone after being opened. It's not a bug, but it's a feature!

I think it will be problematic if users forgot what were they talking about.

#### Suggestions
- Remove auto disappearing messages feature<br>
  Users can manually delete the message if they didn't want to keep that message by pressing the delete button.
